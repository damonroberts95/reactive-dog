# DogMatic Dog Listing App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The compiled and built app is avaliable here: https://damonroberts95.github.io/reactive-dog/

To run the development project, clone or download the repo, and run `npm start` in its directory. 

# Issues:

* Search/Select input isn't great, currently it takes expands fully when clicked. It also doesn't seem to fire onChange until a breed has been clicked on, so typing the name still requires the user to click on the breed they want. 
* Naming conventions could be improved.
